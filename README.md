# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Console Based Game (AI Internship Project)

A smart little console game where you challenge a basic AI in classic **Tic-Tac-Toe**. Built with Python for my **CodeClause Internship** — no GUI, just pure logic.
It's a fun way to explore game logic and build simple artificial intelligence in Python.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- No external libraries

---

## 🧠 Features
- Choose to play as `X` or `O`
- AI plays smart: blocks, attacks, wins
- Instant win/draw detection
- Simple CLI interface

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Noor3800/CodeClauseInternship_T3-AI.git
   cd CodeClauseInternship_T3-AI

2. Run the script
   ```bash
   Tic_Tac_Toe.py

3. Start playing!

- Choose your move by entering a number between 1–9
- The AI will respond with its move
- First to 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins

## 🤖 AI Strategy (Basic Logic)

- First, try to win if possible
- If the user is about to win, block them
- Otherwise, take the center, then corners, then sides (if available)

## 💡 What I Learned

- Learned AI decision-making
- Improved Python logic handling
- Realized consoles can be cool too 😎
- Console-based input/output handling
- Enhancing user experience without a GUI

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- 🔲 Add GUI using Tkinter or Pygame
- 🧠 Improve AI using Minimax algorithm
- 🎮 Add scoreboard and replay option
